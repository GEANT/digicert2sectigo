  Hello. You have received this certificate from Sectigo (the TCS provider)
  because of a problem with the current certificate you have installed.
  All NRENs have received a notification from GÃ‰ANT about this problem.
  Briefly, the previous company we used (DigiCert) have identified a
  problem with their service and will be revoking all affected
  certificates on 11th July 2020.
  Please can you replace your current certificate and full chain with this
  one before 11th July 2020. We have used the original CSR you created and
  therefore the operation should be seamless for you.
